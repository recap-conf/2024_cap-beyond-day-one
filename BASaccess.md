# workshop

For this workshop, there are prepared test users for you. 
Each user has its own *space* in a shared *BTP Subaccount*.
Each user is assigned the *Subaccount Viewer* role, to be able to view the instances and subscriptions.
Also each user is entitled to use the Business Application Studio (BAS).
We recommend using BAS as development environment, as all the tools are automatically installed and up to date there.
Please note however, that the account will be deleted after the workshop, so if you want to save your project you will need to connect to your github or download it.

You can access the BTP subaccount [here](https://canary.cockpit.btp.int.sap/cockpit?idp=avpxtt84j.accounts400.ondemand.com#/globalaccount/cdd5e7c7-a590-4fe4-9baa-32008b024055/accountModel&//?section=SubaccountsSection&view=TreeTableView)

The logon credentials will be provided by the workshop hosts.
